	Nom		ο ς						ο-ι 						ω
	Gen		ου (from ο-(ι)ο)		ων 							ο + ιν
	Dat		ῳ (from ο-ι)			ο-ις 	or 	ο-ισι(ν)		ο + ιν
	Acc		ο-ν						ους (from ο-νς) 			ω
	Voc		ε						ο-ι 						ω

Second Declension Masculine 

			Singular									Plural

	Nom		ος = ο + ς					[S 229]			οι = ο + ι		[S 229]
	Gen		ου = ο +(ι) + ο 			[S 230.1]		ων = ο + ων 	[S 229.b]
	Dat		ῳ = ο + αι					[S 228.b]		οις/οισι(ν)	= ο + ισ(ιν)
	Acc		ον = ο + ν					[S 229]			ους = ο + νς 	[S 230.4] 
																		[M 24.4] 	
	Voc		ε (ε is thematic vowel)		[S 228.b]		οι = ο + ι 		[S 229]

Some Rules Taken from Smyth 229–230:
1) The dat. sing. in -ῳ represents the union of the stem vowel -ο and ai, the original case ending in the I. E. languages. [S 228.b]
1a) Forms in -οι, as οἴκοι at home, may be locatives (-ο + ί, the locative ending). [S 228.b]
2) Stem vowel varies between ο and ε [S 228.b].
3) The Gen Plural -ων is due to the onion of -ο + ων, which contracted to -ων in the earliest period of the language [S 228.b].
4) Genitive Singular:
	4a) οιο appears in Homer
	4b) Loses ι and becomes οο
	4c) Contraction becomes ου in Homer, Ionic, Milder Doric
	4d) οο also appears as οο in Homer
	4e) οο also becomes ω in Aeolic and Severer Doric
5) Accusative Plural ους is from -ον-ς (found in Cretan), that is, the accus. sing. + ς. From -ονς comes -ως Severer Doric, -οις Aeolic, -ος Cretan and in Dor. poetry. -ους is Hom., Ionic, and Milder Doric. [S 230.4]

Rules Taken from Mounce [M 2.10]
6) Roots with σ between two vowels
	6a) The σ drops out
	6b) The remaining vowels do not contract
	6c) When combined with a second word (creating a compound or polysyllabic word), contraction occurs (M 2.10)
7) ν drops out when immediately followed by σ, and the final stem vowel is lengthened to compensate for the loss [§24.4].


Special Comments About 2nd Declension
8) There are second declension feminine nouns
9) There are contract 2nd declension nouns that function according to contract euphony rules. For instnce χειμάρρους is from χειμάρρο + ο + ς. ο + ο contract to become ου, thus the ους ending [S 235; M p. 188]
	9a) Homeric and Ionic generally have the open forms. οἰνοχόος wine-pourer does not contract in Attic since it stands for οἰνοχοϝος [S 235]
