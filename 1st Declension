Declensions

1st Declension

RULES

	UNIVERSALS
	1)	Stems: all stems end α | η
	2)	Gender: most are feminine, a few masculine, never neuter
	3) 	Number: all plural forms are identical
	4)	Case: genitive singular ας | ης | ου | α | η

	PARTICULARS
	1a)	Feminine nouns ending in εα | ια | ρα and a genitive ας:
			- the α is consistent throughout the singular, except when ρ does not precede final α; then genitive/dative singular ending is η			
			- Exceptions (Mounce 168)	
				- 5 nouns end in ρα but follow 1c declension pattern
				- 9 nouns do not end in εα | ια | ρα but decline as 1a

			n/v singular 	-			n/v plural	ι
			gen singular 	ς			gen plural	ων
			dat singular 	ι*[1] 		dat plural 	ις
			acc singular 	ν 			acc plural	νς*[2]

			*Euphony rules
				[1] final stem vowel lengthens and the iota subscripts
				[2] ν drops when immediately followed by σ	
	
	1b)	Feminine nouns with stems ending in η and a genitive ης:
			- the η is consistent throughout the singular

			Same declension as 1a

	1c)	Feminine nouns with α stem ending (except when preceded by ε | ι | ρ) and a genitive ης
			- gen/dat sing ending is η

			Same declension as 1a

	1d)	Masculine nouns with stems ending in α(ς) and genitive ου:
			- all but four of the words in this category are proper names (Mounce 175)

			nom singular 	ς*[3]		nom plural	ι
			gen singular 	ου*[4]		gen plural	ων
			dat singular 	ι*[1] 	 	dat plural 	ις
			acc singular 	ν 			acc plural	νς*[2]
			voc singular 	- 			voc plural 	-

			*Notes
				[3] first decl masc nouns use alternate ς ending in the nom sg
				[4] first decl masc nouns don't use ς for gen sg to avoid confusion with nom sg


	1e) Masculine nouns with stems ending in α(ς) and genitive α:
			- no occurences of plural in NT

			nom singular 	ς*[3]			
			gen singular 	-*[4]			
			dat singular 	ι*[1] 	 	
			acc singular 	ν

			dat singular 	ι*[1] 	 	dat plural 	ις
			acc singular 	ν 			acc plural	νς*[2]
			voc singular 	α|η*[5]	voc plural 	-

			*Notes
				- if the stem ends in τη, the voc is α; if the 1f noun ends in anything else, the voc is η

			acc singular 	- 			
			voc singular 	-

	CONDENSED

	1st Declension = Fem | Masc

	1st Decl Fem = PureAlpha | Mixed | Pure Eta

		PureAlpha = α stem vowel when letter before stem vowel is ε | ι | ρ
		Mixed = α stem vowel for Nom, Acc, Voc; η for Gen, Dat when letter before stem vowel is a sibilant
		PureEta = η stem vowel when letter is not ε | ι | ρ | sibilant
