labial before sigma becomes Psi
Velar before sigma becomes Xi
dental before sigma drops (the dental drops)

voiceless stops (Pi, Tau, Kappa) becomes aspirated (Phi, Theta, Chi) when a rough breathing follows immediately. §64

A labial or velar stop before a dental stop must be of the same voice type (voiceless + voiceless, voiced + voiced) §82
A dental stop before another dental stop becomes sigma §83
