Some Rules Taken from Smyth 229–230:
1) The dat. sing. in -ῳ represents the union of the stem vowel -ο and ai, the original case ending in the I. E. languages. [S 228.b]
1a) Forms in -οι, as οἴκοι at home, may be locatives (-ο + ί, the locative ending). [S 228.b]
2) Stem vowel varies between ο and ε [S 228.b].
3) The Gen Plural -ων is due to the onion of -ο + ων, which contracted to -ων in the earliest period of the language [S 228.b].
4) Genitive Singular:
	4a) οιο appears in Homer
	4b) Loses ι and becomes οο
	4c) Contraction becomes ου in Homer, Ionic, Milder Doric
	4d) οο also appears as οο in Homer
	4e) οο also becomes ω in Aeolic and Severer Doric
5) Accusative Plural ους is from -ον-ς (found in Cretan), that is, the accus. sing. + ς. From -ονς comes -ως Severer Doric, -οις Aeolic, -ος Cretan and in Dor. poetry. -ους is Hom., Ionic, and Milder Doric. [S 230.4]

Rules Taken from Mounce [M 2.10]
6) Roots with σ between two vowels
	6a) The σ drops out
	6b) The remaining vowels do not contract
	6c) When combined with a second word (creating a compound or polysyllabic word), contraction occurs (M 2.10)
7) ν drops out when immediately followed by σ, and the final stem vowel is lengthened to compensate for the loss (§24.4).
