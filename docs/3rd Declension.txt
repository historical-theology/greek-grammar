Third Declension

Rules:
1) Find stem of 3rd declension noun by eliminating Genitive Singular ending. [M. p. 191, n-3a]

2) Stems ending in π, β, φ have the following rules [M. p. 191, n-3a]:
	2a) π + σ = ψ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	2b) β + σ = ψ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	2c) φ + σ = ψ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	2d) Endings for 3rd declension nouns ending in π, β, φ

	Acc		α				ας 		
	Voc		ς				ες	

3) Stems ending in κ, γ, χ have the following rules [M. p. 192, n-3b]:
	3a) κ + σ = ξ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	3b) γ + σ = ξ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	3c) χ + σ = ξ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	3d) Endings for 3rd declension nouns ending in κ, γ, χ:

	3e) Exceptions (M 192, n-3b(1, 2, 3))
		3e1) ἀλώπηξ, ἡ: 
			3e1a) The genitive ἀλώπεκος shows that the final stem vowel is actually an ε. 
			3e1b) In the nominative singular, the ε lengthens as if it were undergoing strong vowel gradation.
		3e2) γυνή, ἡ:
			3e2a) The genitive is γυναικός. 
			3e2b) The nominative singular lengthens the final stem vowel and loses the final ικ. This is reminiscent of vowel gradation, although the η } αι shift is not a normal pattern (cf. §4). 
			3e2c) Its full paradigm is, γυνή, γυναικός, γυναικί, γυναῖκα, γύναι; γυναῖκες, γυναικῶν, γυναιξῖ(ν), γυναῖκας.
		3e3) θρίξ, ἡ:
			3e3a) The stem is really *θριχ. 
			3e3b) Since Greek did not like two aspirates (θ, χ) close together, whenever the χ is present the θ deaspirates to τ. 
			3e3c) The θ reappears whenever the χ becomes ξ, because of the σ of the case ending.

4) Stems ending in τ, δ, θ have the following rules [M. p. 193, n-3c]:
	4a) τ + σ = σ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	4b) δ + σ = σ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	4c) θ + σ = σ (in nominative singular and dative plural)
	4d) Endings for 3rd declension nouns ending in τ, δ, θ:

	4e) Exceptions
		4e1) Accusative singular χάριν appears as such 44 and as χάριτα twice in NT

5) Stems ending in ματ have the following rules [M. p. 195–6, n-3c]:
	5a) τ drops off because it cannot stand at the end of the word (nom singular)
	5b) τ + σ = σ (dative plural)
	5c) all nouns in this category are neuter

	Gen		ος 				ων 	
	Dat		ι				σι(ν)			
	Acc		ø				α 		
	Voc		ø				α

6) Stems ending in ντ with ς in nominative singular have the following rules [M. p. 195–6, n-3c]:
	6a) ν + τ + σ = ο lengthening to ου + σ (nom sing and dat plural; sigma with dental and nu leave only sigma and creates lengthening on stem vowel)
	6b) all nouns in this category are masculine

	Nom		ς				ες
	Gen		ος 				ων 	
	Dat		ι				σι(ν)

7) Stems ending in ντ with no ending in nominative singular have the following rules [M. p. 195–6, n-3c]:
	7a) τ drops off because it cannot stand at the end of the word (nom singular)
	7b) ο undergoes ablaut lengthening and becomes ω.
	7c) All nouns in this category are masculine
